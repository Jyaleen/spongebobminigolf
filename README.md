The final code can be found in minigolf.ino! In the other files, we're figuring out different kinds of sensors. We decided to keep them since they could be useful resources for us down the line.

The sensors we ended up using are different than we'd first planned. The servo to move Mr. Krab's claw up and down remained the same, but we ended up replacing the flex sensor and MP3 player component with an ultrasonic sensor and LED RGBs (that will detect when the golf ball enters the hole, and emit a green light when a player scores).
